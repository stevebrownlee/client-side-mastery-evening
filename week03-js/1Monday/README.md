# Week 3 - Day 1

> **Agenda:** Dev tools, Loops and the dom

## Dev Tools
This should be an overview to the dev tools - we will be using them continuously over the next few million years.  Show students the following:
* How to open their dev tools
* What each tab in the dev tools does
* How to debug code in the browser - console.log, debugger, breakpoints. Do this as part of the loop and dom lecture.
Notes for all the above can be found [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/dev-tools.md)
