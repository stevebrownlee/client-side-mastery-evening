# HTML

This code goes with the HTML lecture.  

We will be re-creating the html from:

http://www.csszengarden.com/149/

* NOTE: we will NOT be following the traditional zen garden instructions (ie not using their html).  Instead we will look at that specific CSS Zen Garden and create what we feel are the appropriate divs.


I have put a lot of IDs in this HTML so we can use the dev tools to inspect our html and see how things are nested.  We will remove the majority of these IDs when we do the css in the next lecture.
