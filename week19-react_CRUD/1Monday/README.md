# Week 19 - Day 1

> **Agenda:** React and FB - CREATE

1.  Create Board
* Create BoardForm component that displays on button click
* add form with appropriate inputs
* add functions that set state of input
* add saveBoard function that creates a board object and then calls this.props.saveNewBoard and passes new board object
* write saveNewBoard function in App - should do a Axios.post and then re-call getBoards

2.  Create Pin
Give students an hour to do this themselves - then go over it. (you may need to give them a hint on where to get boardId - #props)
