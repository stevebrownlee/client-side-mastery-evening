# Week 20 - Day 1

> **Agenda:** Angular Movie History

## Introduce Making Aliases
1. create ~/.bash_profile
1. Open bash_profie in sublime/vs code
1. Create aliases
1. Source bash_profiles

#### file aliases
* ```alias workspace='cd workspace'```

#### github aliases:
* ```alias gs='git status'```
* ```alias gb='git branch'```
* ```alias gf='git fetch'```
* ```alias gbr='git branch -av'```
* ```alias ga='function _cob(){ git add "$1";};_cob'```
* ```alias gcb='function _cob(){ git checkout -b "$1";};_cob'```
* ```alias gc='function _co(){  git checkout "$1";};_co'```
* ```alias gcm='function _cmm(){ git commit -m "$1";};_cmm'```
* ```alias gp='function _gp(){ git push origin "$1";};_gp'```
* ```alias gpull='function _gpull(){ git pull origin "$1";};_gpull'```


## Create Contacts Repo
1. Make new repo called contacts
1. Add zoe, callan, and lauren as collaborators
1. Classtracker will have an assignment each day - this will give you a branch name to create.
1.  At the end of each night you should make a PR and comment your status if you are not done.
1. Take the time to make a good PR - you can't start on the next assignment until the first PR is merged in - if you have to do a lot of back and forth with callan or lauren that won't leave you much time to work on the next assignment
1. If one instructor has started your review that instructor will finish your review - ie if Callan doesn't liek your PR don't go ask Lauren if you can merge.  The only exception is if I step in and give a thumbs up.
