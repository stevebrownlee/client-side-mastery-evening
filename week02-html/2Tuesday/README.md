# Week 2 - Day 2

> **Agenda:** Git review, css, flexbox

## Review git branching
Take a class pulse and ask how they are doing with git branching.  If the class wants feel free to go over it as a class again.


## Flexbox Part 1- intro and setup
1. Talk a little about what flexbox is (they all did some as part of the prework so this shouldn't be anything new).
1.  They show them the [CSS tricks site](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).  Walk them through how to use the site - its their first time looking at documentation (RTFM!!!!)
1. Create a repo called flexbox-intro (`~/workspace/foundations/inclass/flexbox-intro`)
1. have them go through all the usual stuff - make readme and push to master, make setup branch and do the stuff
1.  go over setup and then push, PR, and merge

## Flexbox Part 2 - navbar
1. make a navbar branch
1. build out the navbar - this time it has a brand and flex

1. Make sure navbar links all work
1. PR and merge branch in

## Flexbox Part 3 - home

## Flexbox Part 5 - Challenge Cats
1. Make a cats branch

1. Have students share their work - have them pull open their cats page, get everyone to stand up.  And give 5ish min for people to walk around and look at others work
1.  PR and merge branch in

## Remaining Time
IF ANY TIME LEFT - Have students make 5 repos (test1 - test5 or test6 - test10 if they did some yesterday) that have single setup branch and everything merged in so master has index.html, main.css, main.js files.  Should see h1 tag, background color change, and console.log statement in each. This is to build muscle memory with git commands.  Slack me when you get to this point so I can gage when to come in and talk about HW

## HW
I will come in and go over this.  I will also talk about the class tracker site.
