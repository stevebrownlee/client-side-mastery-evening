# Week 2 - Day 1

> **Agenda:** github review, HTML

## Review git branching

* Have students make a folder called branch-review in `~/workspace/foundations/inclass`
* Then suddenly get amnesia and let students direct you with how to make a git repo with setup branch merged in:
1. Locally make a README.md with title in it - add and commit
1. Create github repo called branch-review
1. Set remote and push to master
1. Make a branch called setup
1. make index.html, main.css, main.js.  js file should have console.log. css file should change background color.  Index should have boilerplate, link and script tag
1. run code to make sure it works
1. add, commit, push to setup
1. make pull request to master
1. merge PR
1. locally switch to master and pull down

## 2nd review (if needed)
If the above step by step process doesn't seem to go well have them do all the steps again on another repo.
