# Week 2 Labday - CSS 101

## What is CSS?

In the earliest days of the World Wide Web, there were just documents. The Web was intended to share research documents, and so things that we see now like dynamic applications, beautiful layouts and colors, and cool animations were not even thought of.

Then, companies started to see a glimmer of promise for making money on the Web, so they started sharing their documents. Plain, boring text didn't cut it, so the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) released CSS1 in 1996 so that professional web page developers - there weren't that many yet - could create more stylized documents with complex layouts and color schemes.

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Have students open up their HTML101 blog [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) and start adding CSS to that project.

## Selecting an element

1. Show how to select elements by class, and by id.
1. Show how to select child, descendant, and sibling elements.

## Adding colors

## Changing fonts (face, weight, and size)

1. Change the default font of the body.
2. Make different elements have different font faces.

## Aligning text

1. Give examples of left, center, and right aligned text.

## Floating elements

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Break now for a class exercise (shown below). Have students open up their  profile on [Codepen ](http://codepen.io/) and add a navigation bar to their profile.

## Create navigation with lists and CSS

Show students how to convert a standard `<ul>` element into a usable navigation section at the top of the page.

```css
.nav {
    background-color: goldenrod;
    height: 30px;
}

.nav > li {
    float: left;
    list-style-type: none;
    margin: 5px 15px 0 15px;
    font-family: "Arial";
    cursor: pointer;
}

.nav > li:hover {
    color: white;
}
```

## Validation for HTML5 inputs

With some of the new HTML5 input types, specifically the `url` and `email` types, the specification required that browsers provide the ability to write CSS pseudo classes that allows developers to style the inputs based on  the default validation rules.

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label>Enter a URL:</label>
    <input type="url" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <label>Enter an email address:</label>
    <input type="email" required/>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css
input:valid {
  background-color: #ddffdd;
}

input:invalid {
  background-color: #ffdddd;
}
```
