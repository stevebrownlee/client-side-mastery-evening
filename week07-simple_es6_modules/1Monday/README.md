# Week 7 - Day 1

> **Agenda:** Simple ES6 Modules

## 50 Shades Demo
This project is designed to show the problem with global variables.  It has a variable called bookInfo that contains information about the book.

To change the book price:
* Load the page
* Open chrome console
* Type: ```bookInfo.price = 0.01```

## Build out the 50 Shades Project with modules
* Create `javascripts/helpers/book.js`  with the book info
* Import that into main.js and show how you can get stuff from other files
* Create store component
* Create cart component
