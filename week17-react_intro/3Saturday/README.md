# Week 17 - Day 3

> **Agenda:** Intro to React and React Setup

NOTE:  All work for today will go in `~/workspace/react/inclass`

## Agenda
1. Spend 20ish minutes talking about react - what is it, what does it do, why would you want to use it
2. Slowly run the class through using create-react-app. (including what the new setup branch is) - make a project called react-intro
3. Have the class make another project to practice the setup (give them 20 minutes and then go over it) - make a project called react-intro2
4. Have the class setup the rest of the projects that will be needed for the new few weeks:

## What is react?
Feel free to elaborate/go on a tangent - here are the MVP talking points:
* What is React?
  * [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/)
  * React is "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"
  * JS libraries are collections of pre-written JS functions.
  * It was built and is maintained by facebook.  It was first released in 2013
* What does it do?
  * Components, components, components!!
  * React was built around creating components
* Why would you want to use it?


## Setup a Practice Project
* The lecture notes for setting up a react project are [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/react/book-4-react/chapters/react-setup.md).  You can send this link out to the class in Slack.  It is also already on classtracker.
* Please go through that document and show them STEP by STEP.  High level:
  * What is create-react-app?  talk about difference between npm and npx (npx is just scripts that run)
  * npx create-react-app intro-react
  * Create github repo called intro-react and push everything generated from create-react-app to master
  * Create setup branch - move files around, add some front end dependencies, add eslint, kill testing
  * push everything up to setup branch and merge in
* What to watch out for:
  * They are used to creating github project WITH a readme - this won't work for create-react-app
  * They tend not to read so if you get asked STUPID questions tell them to RTFM. #toughlove

## Setup practice #2
* Have students create a repo called `intro-react2` and then go through all the same steps locally they did as you did.
* Give them about 20 minutes to do the above on their own and then walk them through it on your machine

## Create ALL The projects
* The rest of the class students can do at their own pace
* Free them to take a lunch break and complete the repos in whatever order they want.  They need to remain in the building until 2 so this is not an early dismissal just free time to go at their own pace.
* Repos that need to be made:
  * shark-attack
  * sports-roster
  * doggie-day-care
