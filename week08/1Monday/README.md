# Week 8 - Day 1

> **Agenda:** Bootstrap and XHR


We will be using Bootstrap 3.3.7 NOT Bootstrap 4 for the following reasons:
1.  90% of the code in town is legacy and uses Bootsrap 3
2.  Bootstrap 4 has only been out of beta since January 18, 2018
3.  ASP.NET Core build still includes 3.3.7 so you will need it in the backend
4.  Understanding Bootstrap 3 and flexbox will make the transition to bootstrap 4 SUPER easy
