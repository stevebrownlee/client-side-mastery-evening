# Week 2 - Day 3

> **Agenda:** JS Overview

Crash course in JS.  Its 4 one hour sessions with an hour lunch break

MAKE THIS INTERACTIVE - HAND OUT DUCKS TO CORRECT ANSWERS.

## SETUP - give them 15 minutes to do this
* Have them create a new github repo called js-intro.  I have already created this repo for [E10](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-10/js-intro) - https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-10/js-intro
* They should push README.md to master branch
* Make a setup branch and add index.html, main.css, main.js.  Link everthing together and serve it up
* Once background color changes, console.log works, and h1 tag shows they can PR and merge.

## Functions (1 hour)
Class notes are [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/js-functions.md)
* Play the [nugget factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUTXsPFx-qQ) video about functions.  Kinda disturbing but gets the point across.
* Talk about difference between ES6 and ES5 - you can find notes for that [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/es6-vs-es5.md)
* Have students make a `functions` branch
* Have students make a `functions.js` file and add a script tag
* Do example function problems - there are 2.
* Give them a few minutes to do the practice functions - there are 2
* PR and merge the `functions` branch

## Objects (45 minutes)
Class notes for Objects are [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/js-objects.md)
Class notes for Strings are [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/js-strings.md)
* have students make a `objects` branch
* Strings - Explain the difference between `==` and `===`
* Strings - talk about `if` statements
* Strings - have a ton of methods.  Show the MDN page for strings and pick out 2 methods to show (good options are .indexOf and .length)
* Objects - talk about key value pairs
* Pick something arbitrary and represent it with an object.  I have done an employee and an expense as examples
* Go over dot notation and bracket notation
* Give them `statusMaker` challenge
* PR and merge the `objects` branch

## LUNCH BREAK (1 hour)

## Arrays (1 hour)
Class notes are [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/js-array-methods.md)
* have students make a `arrays` branch
* Go over each of the array methods in the Class notes above
* Give students challenge problems
* PR and merge the `arrays` branch

## Combination Special (1 hour)
* have students make a `combo` branch
* Most of what we do involves combinations of things.  Specifically arrays of objects.  This section is just a grab bag of anything - minus loops - ain't nobody got time for loops
* Give them the challenge problems one at a time.  Then go over their answers
* PR and merge the `combo` branch

## Extra Time?
* Show them [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com).  Show them how to search for Katas - 8 is easy level.  They can filter by topic - arrays, strings, objects.  Its a fun way to get some practice
