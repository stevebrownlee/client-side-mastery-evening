# Week 2 - Day 3

> **Agenda:** JS Functions, ES6 vs ES5

### Github branching review
* Answer all github questions
* Review how to make a repository
* Create a branch called `za-intro`

### Nugget Factory
* Play the [nugget factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUTXsPFx-qQ) video about functions.  Kinda disturbing but gets the point across.
* Go to the intro branch and tinker with a few things
    * Use console.log to print stuff out
    * Show how to add in breakpoints

### Write stuff to the DOM
* Problem - we want to take a number add 3 and then print it to the DOM using document.getElementById.  This creates a BUNCH of duplicate code.
* solution - write two functions one that takes the number and adds it and then a second that prints to the DOM

### Remaining Time
* Practice problem
* Discussion about ES6 vs ES5
