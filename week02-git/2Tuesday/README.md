# Week 2 - Day 2

> **Agenda:** Git review, html/css, flexbox

## Review git branching

* Have students make a folder called branch-review in `~/workspace/foundations/inclass`
* Then suddenly get amnesia and let students direct you with how to make a git repo with setup branch merged in:
1. Locally make a README.md with title in it - add and commit
1. Create github repo called branch-review
1. Set remote and push to master
1. Make a branch called setup
1. make index.html, main.css, main.js.  js file should have console.log. css file should change background color.  Index should have boilerplate, link and script tag
1. run code to make sure it works
1. add, commit, push to setup
1. make pull request to master
1. merge PR
1. locally switch to master and pull down

## 2nd review (if needed)
If the above step by step process doesn't seem to go well have them do all the steps again on another repo.

## Flexbox
Talk a little about what flexbox is (they all did some as part of the prework so this shouldn't be anything new).  They show them the [CSS tricks site](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).  Walk them through how to use the site - its their first time looking at documentation (RTFM!!!!)

Have them create a new github repo called flexbox-intro.  I have already created this repo for [E10](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-10/flexbox-intro) - https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-10/flexbox-intro

Have them push README.md to master and then create a setup branch that changes the background color of the body and does a console.log.  Once they push to master you are ready to go with the lecture

Do a quick reminder discussion of when to branch - by feature.  So we will be doing a navbar branch and a dogs branch.

Make the navbar branch and do all the code things and then PR.

Make the dogs branch and do all the code things and then PR.

## HW
Go over their HW.  It can be found [HERE](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-10/e10-homework/blob/master/week02.md).  Explain each assignment - 25 github repos, product cards (done at studygroup).  Show them flexbox froggy and do the first challenge with them.  Any remaining classtime can be used for HW time.  If you finish and its after 9 but before 9:30 let them go home early.
